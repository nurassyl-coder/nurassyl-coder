👋 Hi, I’m Nurassyl — a mobile developer passionate about creating clean and user-friendly apps with Flutter, BLoC, and Firebase.
📱 I enjoy building apps that solve everyday problems — from productivity tools to learning bots and lifestyle trackers.             
🛠️ Turning ideas into practical mobile experiences and improving my skills step by step is what drives me.               
🌱 Always curious, I keep learning new technologies in mobile and backend development.
